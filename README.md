This project was created just to make a try to understang library instagram4j. (org.brunocvcunha.instagram4j)

As a result here is was created a project which gives a possiblity to find and store in a database all users
which will have russian (Cyrilic) language in their profiles. So, if you'd like to find some russian speaker 
around you, this should help.

Steps of executing:
1. Provide location where search should be made

2. It will try to find this place in google geo to be sure that name of location is right written

3. After it should login via one of the provided accounts in the Instagram and start searching.

4. It will save last photos/videos from this location per russian user.

5. All photos/videos will be saved in a provided folder. (folders will have names of users)

6. Also all users will be stored in a database.
